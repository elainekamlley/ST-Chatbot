# ST-Chatbot

This is a simple chatbot that is Star Trek inspired. Computer responds to various inputs from the Captain. 

### What is happening in this code: 
The Captain (you) enters one of the command in the input field (list of commands are below). If the text entered matches predefined strings in the available commands, then the "Computer" returns a response. If none of them are matched, then it returns the default of "Access denied"

I've added notes in the JavaScript file to say what the code is doing

Possible commands: 
- Locate number 1
- Tea, earl grey, hot
- Red alert!
- List all crew members

### What I want to improve:
- Redesign how the interaction with the computer renders. 
- Delay response 
- Use regular expressions to improve the grammar of the responses
- Detect the use of a certain command and have response for multiple trys
